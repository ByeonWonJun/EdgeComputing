# Ganesha Config Example
#
# This is a commented example configuration file for Ganesha.  It is not
# complete, but only has some common configuration options.  See the man pages
# for complete documentation.
#
###################################################

## These are core parameters that affect Ganesha as a whole.
#NFS_CORE_PARAM {
	## Allow NFSv3 to mount paths with the Pseudo path, the same as NFSv4,
	## instead of using the physical paths.
	#mount_path_pseudo = true;

	## Configure the protocols that Ganesha will listen for.  This is a hard
	## limit, as this list determines which sockets are opened.  This list
	## can be restricted per export, but cannot be expanded.
	#Protocols = 3,4,9P;
#}

## These are defaults for exports.  They can be overridden per-export.
#EXPORT_DEFAULTS {
	## Access type for clients.  Default is None, so some access must be
	## given either here or in the export itself.
	#Access_Type = RW;
#}

## Configure settings for the object handle cache
#MDCACHE {
	## The point at which object cache entries will start being reused.
	#Entries_HWMark = 100000;
#}

## Configure an export for some file tree
#EXPORT
#{
	## Export Id (mandatory, each EXPORT must have a unique Export_Id)
	#Export_Id = 12345;

	## Exported path (mandatory)
	#Path = /nonexistant;

	## Pseudo Path (required for NFSv4 or if mount_path_pseudo = true)
	#Pseudo = /nonexistant;

	## Restrict the protocols that may use this export.  This cannot allow
	## access that is denied in NFS_CORE_PARAM.
	#Protocols = 3,4;

	## Access type for clients.  Default is None, so some access must be
	## given. It can be here, in the EXPORT_DEFAULTS, or in a CLIENT block
	#Access_Type = RW;

	## Whether to squash various users.
	#Squash = root_squash;

	## Allowed security types for this export
	#Sectype = sys,krb5,krb5i,krb5p;

	## Exporting FSAL
	#FSAL {
		#Name = VFS;
	#}
#}

## Configure logging.  Default is to log to Syslog.  Basic logging can also be
## configured from the command line
#LOG {
	## Default log level for all components
	#Default_Log_Level = WARN;

	## Configure per-component log levels.
	#Components {
		#FSAL = INFO;
		#NFS4 = EVENT;
	#}

	## Where to log
	#Facility {
		#name = FILE;
		#destination = "/var/log/ganesha.log";
		#enable = active;
	#}
#}
