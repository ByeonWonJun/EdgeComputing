LOG {
	# The components block contains one or more logging components
	# and the setting to be used.
	components {
	  # The ALL component is special.  When set it defines the level
	  # for all components and overrides any other setting in this block.
	  # For convenience, many component names can be specified using two
	  # different values. One is the #define constant without the
	  # COMPONENT_ prefix, for example, HASHTABLE_CACHE. The other is
	  # the string that shows up in the actual log with blank replaced with
	  # underscore, for example HT_CACHE.
	  #
	  # Log levels are:
	  #
	  # NULL, FATAL, MAJ, CRIT, WARN, EVENT, INFO, DEBUG, MID_DEBUG,
	  # FULL_DEBUG
	  #
#	  ALL = FULL_DEBUG; # this will likely kill performance
#	  ALL = EVENT; # this is the default
#	  INIT = INFO;
#	  RPC = FULL_DEBUG;
#	  DBUS = DEBUG;
