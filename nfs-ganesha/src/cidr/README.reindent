This code is imported from:

 http://www.over-yonder.net/~fullermd/projects/libcidr

It was inadvertently re-indented. I has been run through
checkpatch.pl but the errors have not been fixed.  Since this
is upstream code, it should be removed and replaced by build
linkage to the library itself, built separately.  This is a
V2.1+ task.
