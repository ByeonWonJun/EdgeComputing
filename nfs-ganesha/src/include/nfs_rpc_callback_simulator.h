 * \brief RPC callback dispatch package
 *
 * \section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This module implements APIs for submission, and dispatch of NFSv4.0
 * and (soon) NFSv4.1 format callbacks.
 *
 * Planned strategy is to deal with all backchannels from a small number of
 * service threads, initially 1, using non-blocking socket operations.  This
 * may change, as NFSv4.1 bi-directional support is integrated.
