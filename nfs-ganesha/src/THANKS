This files list the people, outside of the original development team that help in the project.
Their contributions were very helpful, so I guess they should have their names listed somewhere.

Thanks to:
   Contributors that are not colleagues or students
	- Tom "spot" Callaway <tcallawa@redhat.com>, for his experience and wiseness in RPM packaging. 
	- People from maling-list nfsv4@linux-nfs.org (with special attention to J. Bruce Fields 
	  and Trond Myklebust) for their help understanding the complex logic within NFSv4
	- Eric Sesterhenn <eric.sesterhenn@lsexperts.de> who provided a nice patch fixing memleaks.
	- Erik Levinson <erik@caneris.com> who did lots of work to make libnfsidmap work with gssrpc in nfs-ganesha
	- Sean Dague <japh@us.ibm.com> who provides me with several typos and memleaks patches
	- Aneesh Kumar K. V. <aneesh.kumar@linux.vnet.ibm.com> who implemented NLMv4 support (locking for NFSv3)
	- Frank Filz <ffilzlnx@us.ibm.com> who provided me with several small fixes on the server's behavior. He idesigned i
          and wrote as well the new Log layer API.

   Students that came to make an intership with us and worked on the project
	- Mickael Guerin who wrote the first release of the FSAL_POSIX
	- Laureline Provost who wrote a PERL library that had been very useful to quickly write benchmarks 
          and non-regression test
	- Cedric Cabessa who worked on the SNMP admin module
	- Adrien Grellier who provided us with the first TI-RPC support in the product
        - Rémi Duraffort who wrote the FSAL_ZFS implementation as well as the libzfswrap contrib. He fixed many other small bugs too
